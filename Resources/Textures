This folder is intended for storing external texture resources used in the Metal shader pipeline. You can place image files here (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.hdr`) that will be loaded into Metal for use as:

- Background overlays
- LUTs (Lookup Tables)
- Noise maps for film grain
- Custom mask or blending textures

## How to Use
Use `MTKTextureLoader` in Swift to load any of these textures:

```swift
let textureLoader = MTKTextureLoader(device: device)
if let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "noise", withExtension: "png") {
    let texture = try? textureLoader.newTexture(URL: url, options: nil)
}
```

## Notes
- Make sure textures are added to the Xcode target under **Build Phases > Copy Bundle Resources**.
- Use power-of-two sizes (e.g., 512×512, 1024×1024) for better GPU performance.

Feel free to delete this file before submission if not using any textures.
